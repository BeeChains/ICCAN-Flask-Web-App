# ICCAN-Flask-Web-App - Developing...

## Introduction

The ICCAN (Intelligent Camouflage Creative Adversarial Network) Browser Based App is a web application that uses GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) and CAN (Camouflage Adversarial Network) networks to generate new camouflage patterns and images. The app allows users to input parameters such as color, texture, and pattern, and generates a unique camouflage design based on these inputs.

The ICCAN Browser Based App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of multiple components, including a user interface for inputting parameters, a canvas for displaying the generated camouflage design, and a backend that handles the generation process.

## Architecture

The ICCAN Browser Based App follows a client-server architecture. The client side is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions, while the server side handles the generation of camouflage designs using GAN and CAN networks.

The client side is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of an HTML file for the user interface, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for handling user interactions and communicating with the server.

The server side is built using Python and Flask. It consists of a Flask application that handles HTTP requests from the client, a GAN model for generating camouflage designs, and a CAN model for refining the generated designs.
